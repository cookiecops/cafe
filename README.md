### Note : description
### use Google account-> use github account -> use git to finish work at my PC -> use replit account by github -> import Web repl by repo -> make always on to hosting.
## why it's work?
1. index.html is made by Python application.
2. that app is short link generater (Note : repo which be forked)
3. pointing [this site](https://cafe.daum.net/CookieCafe), I'll make this site too.
4. index.html is home page so it'll be hosted
5. it's work! can be web site!, can change language in replit.
